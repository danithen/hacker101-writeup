## Prerequisites:
- git 
  To install git on Manjaro run:  <br>
  `sudo pacman -S git` 
## Getting started:

## Setting up Ruby:

rbenv is a version manager for ruby, we will use it to setup and manage our ruby apps and version.
Because I am on an arch linux distribution, rbenv does not have an official repository, instead we will need to use a few Arch User Repositories (AUR).
