# hacker101-writeup
**This is a write up for [hacker101](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/hacker101.)** <br>
The hacker101 course is a basic introductory course to bugbounties and webhacking. 
This write-up will cover all aspect of this course including: concepts that are new to me, what I learned, problems I faced, solutions and thought process, and the steps/sources I used along the way.
If you are looking for other beginner CTFs/Courses I have write-ups on HackTheBox, Defend the Web, and a few OverTheWire CTFs.
Enjoy and happy hunting.
